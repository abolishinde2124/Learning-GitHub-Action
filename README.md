WHAT IS GITHUB ACTIONS?

GitHub Actions is a feature provided by GitHub to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. It allows you to define tasks you'd like to perform automatically based on certain events, such as :-
pushing code to the repository, 
opening a pull request, or 
creating a release

~ Definition: A workflow is an automated process set up in a repository. It consists of one or more jobs that run in response to a trigger event.

~ File Location: Workflow files are stored in the .github/workflows directory of your repository.

~ Triggers: Workflows can be triggered by events like push, pull_request, issue, schedule, etc.

# Key Features

CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions is often used for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) to automate the testing and deployment of applications.

Event-driven: Workflows can be triggered by various events like push, pull requests, releases, issues, etc.

YAML Configuration: Workflows are defined using YAML files. These files specify the sequence of actions to be executed.

Integration with GitHub: Since it is built into GitHub, it integrates seamlessly with your repositories, making it easier to set up and manage.

Reusable Workflows: Actions can be shared and reused across multiple workflows or projects, facilitating the reuse of common CI/CD tasks.

# Components of GitHub Actions

1] Workflow: A configurable automated process made up of one or more jobs. It is defined in a YAML file stored in the .github/workflows directory of the repository.

2] Job: A set of steps that execute on the same runner. Each job runs in an isolated virtual environment.

3] Step: An individual task that can run commands, use an action, or run a script.

4] Runner: The server that runs the workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners, but you can also use self-hosted runners.

5] Action: A custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a specific task. You can use actions created by the community or create your own.

# Conclusion

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub that automates tasks like testing, building, and deploying code. Its flexibility, ease of use, and integration with GitHub make it an essential tool for modern software development workflows. With GitHub Actions, you can automate and streamline your development processes, ensuring that code is consistently tested and deployed, and freeing up time for developers to focus on coding and innovation.
